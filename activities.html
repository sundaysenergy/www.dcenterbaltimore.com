          <div class="body four columns"><p><strong>Opening reception: Saturday, June 15, 2013  6-8 pm</strong><br />
Baltimore From Many Perspectives is an exhibition featuring nine interconnected Baltimore artists and young artists and dancers from ConneXions School for the Arts, a middle/high school on Baltimore's west side. In this exhibition, each artist chosen to participate by the curator was a part of selecting the remaining artists. Each artist was asked to invite an artist that he or she is connected to but also different from. The exhibition grew organically to include artists of many backgrounds and various mediums including painting, digital media, sound, ceramic, printmaking, mixed media and performance.</p>
<p>Curated by Sarah McCann, this exhibition includes work of Person Ablach, Robert Bilek, John Bohl, Colin Campbell, Jenny Graf, Paula Phillips, Olivia Robinson, Ernest Shaw and Christine Stiver and students from ConneXions School for the Arts who worked with Paula Phillips to create artwork for the exhibition and dance pieces that will be performed at the opening.</p>
<p>D center Baltimore is hosting the exhibition from June 15 to July 21, 2013. The opening reception will be held on June 15 from 6 to 8 p.m. D center is located at 16 W. North Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21218. Gallery is open on Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. and by appointment. Please call 646-573-5509 to schedule. During Artscape the gallery will be open Friday, July 19, from 5 to 7 pm, and Saturday and Sunday, July 20 and 21, from 2 to 6 p.m.</p>

          <div class="body four columns"><p>HOUSE SHOW studies and celebrates the idea of the rowhouse as storyteller. Co-curated by Marianne Amoss, Marian April Glebes, Sarah McCann, and Jessica Young of D center Baltimore, the exhibit examines how these familiar structures serve as narratives, recording and telling our personal stories and the stories of streets, neighborhoods, and entire cities. What are the stories contained within rowhouse walls? How do rowhouses reveal how we live now, and how we used to live?</p>
<p>In keeping with the interdisciplinary mission of both Case[werks] and D center Baltimore, HOUSE SHOW features work in a variety of mediums and by a range of artists, representing architecture, photography, sculpture, oral history, and more.</p>
<p> The exhibit is at Urbanite @ Case[werks] from September 21 through October 24, 2012. The opening reception will be held on September 21, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Complementary programming will take place during the exhibit, both in the gallery and at off-site venues. Additional information about these events is forthcoming.</p>
<p>Urbanite @ Case[werks] is located at 1501 St. Paul Street, Suite 116, Baltimore, MD 21202. The gallery is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. For more information, call 410-332-4160.</p>

Women: An Exhibition invites participating artists and designers of all genders to create work that celebrates the incredible women they have known, loved, and been influenced by. It is a chance to recognize and pay homage to all that the women in our lives have contributed to us.</p>
<p>By showcasing the work of female artists and designers, exhibiting work about women’s roles in industry, and including projects about women known personally (colleagues, family, friends, mentors, role models, etc.), this show celebrates all the facets and roles of women in our lives.</p>
<p>Curated by Sarah McCann, Women includes work by 39 artists from across the nation, 27 of whom work in Maryland (as well as one local Baltimore community organization) and 11 who hail from Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Utah.</p>

          <div class="body four columns"><p>In the past three years, D center Baltimore has been working hard to advocate for design awareness in the Baltimore community and beyond. With our recent expansion into the 218 Saratoga Street storefront gallery, D center @ MAP, and with our receipt of the National Endowment for the Arts Our Town Placemaking Grant for our proposal with Maryland Institute College of Art, Central Baltimore Partnership, and Station North Arts and Entertainment District, we feel now is the time to revisit the questions that inspired our big tent: “Does Baltimore need a design center? If so, what would it look like, and what can it do?”</p>
<p>Network (Temporary Permanent Collection) re-roots and re-inspires the birth of the conversation that lead to the inception of D center: multiple disciplines, ages, and interests, convening on a moment en masse to excite and ignite design discourse in the city. The show features work, projects, and research from contributors, colleagues, and constituents of the design center’s past, present, and future that demonstrate their relationship to design. As an institution built of relationships and collaborations, Network (Temporary Permanent Collection) uses the free-hung salon as a medium to make permanent bonds with invested parties, adding to our collective network rather than physical acquisitions.</p>

          <div class="body four columns"><p>D center @ MAP announces H2OMG, its second exhibition in its storefront gallery at 218 Saratoga Street. H2OMG responds to and expands on the geographic and conceptual boundaries challenged by University of Virginia School of Architecture Professors Robin Dripps, Lucia Phinney, and Jorg Sieweke at Design Conversation #28: Re-envisioning Public Infrastructure. Sieweke’s work explores the future of the Jones Falls River that once shaped the city and has been neglected and buried in an underground culvert to make room for an inner city expressway, while Dripps and Phinney’s studies reveal the potential for a new form of local infrastructure including intersecting networks of rainwater harvesting, collection, and distribution; local agricultural production, processing and sales; and local material salvaging, repurposing, and commercial distribution. A portion of the work in the exhibition was created by students in Sieweke’s graduate design studio at UVA.</p>
<p>H2OMG highlights their research and discourse surrounding the Jones Falls River, past, present, and future, and introduces local voices to the conversation by inviting Baltimore projects that investigate water, urban resources, watersheds, and conceptual and participatory gestures. Biohabitats, whose company mission is to “restore the earth and inspire ecological stewardship” through innovative conservation and regenerative design, will install a living wetland, removed from Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, in the gallery to accompany their research and action on behalf of the city’s water systems.   </p>
<p>Additional participants include but are not limited to Blue Water Baltimore. Curatorial/exhibition design assistance provided by Daphne Lasky, who received her M.Arch. from UVA in 2011.</p>
